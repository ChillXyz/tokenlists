## HOW TO ADD YOUR TOKEN TO TOKENLIST

#### Criteria

- Contract should be verified on block explorers e.g. `explorer.zksync.io`
- Token should have established liquidity, a good number of liquidity providers, and 15 day volume. 

#### Submission process
Please refer to `tokenlist.json` for format, and tag your token appropriately. 
- Submit tokenlist PR separately from logo PR.
- Tag your token with `DeFi`, `GameFi` or `Stablecoins`. - (case sensitive).
